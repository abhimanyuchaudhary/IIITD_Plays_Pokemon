Theme : something new<br />
Run on linux only, on the install npm and do npm start on the directory with index.js. Open an emulator and select that window also run python script and stream on obs on twitch.
For the clients go to the host ip and play using up, down, left, right, a, b, select, start as commands<br />


The idea was to make something that everyone connected to the same network can do together, in this case everyone on campus. The server will run a game on the emulator that everyone can play together. Everyone can send commands together to the same game, this results in chaos and fun. So the goal becomes to finish the game when some people might be trying to send conflicting commands
